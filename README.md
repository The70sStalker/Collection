# Collection of Works in P5.js
## 10-8 File
The first file I uploaded is from **October 8th.** It used user input via the mouse to make "rain" fall from the clouds. Using a variety of shapes and colors, the scene resembles a cloudy day.
## 10-15 File
This file also resembles a rainy day but uses variables and a for loop to repeat shapes. The console also has an output using math to put out a response to the chance of rain.
## 11-5 File
This file uses the p5.polar library created by Liz Peng. I used it to make an example of a randomized pattern using the presets and function given via the library.
